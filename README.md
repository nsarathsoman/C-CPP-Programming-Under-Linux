### Part 1 - 11 : Summary
-------------------------
The series of entries in the blog posts starts with the *`harisree`* equivalent in programming called `HelloWorld` programs, started out or popularized by K & R in their famous book *The C Programming Language*. (harisree - A southern indian tradition marking a child's entry in to the written world of languagues and there by to the world of knowledge. It is observed primarily in Kerala by Hindus on the day of Vijayadasami, even though there are special rituals for children, people can be seen writing `Om Harisree ganapathaye namaha` on sands present around the temple, in programmer communities a similar activity can be seen, every time they start to learn a new programming language they start with a `helloworld` program)

The author then starts focusing on programs accepting commandline arguments, printing the no of arguments recieved and ends the activity in part3 by spitting all the envs inherited by the C/C++ program. In all these steps the learner will be compiling the programs directly to native executables. In the remaining parts the focus is mainly to teach compiling multi-source programs (programs that spans multiple source files), compiling to object file and creating executable by linking the object files. In addition to this the author is teaching the learner to create a shared library and how to link it statically and dynamically. Finally linux io redirection operators are exposed to the learner and shows how to use C/C++ executables as yet another linux command.
